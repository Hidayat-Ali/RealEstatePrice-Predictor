# 🏠 Real Estate Price Predictor

A web application that predicts house prices in Indian cities based on area (sqft), number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and location using machine learning. Built with **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Predict house prices using a trained **Linear Regression / ML model**.
- Dynamic **location selection** fetched from the backend.
- Clean and responsive **frontend** with Bootstrap 5.
- Supports real-time price estimation.
- Production-ready FastAPI backend with **Pickle model loading**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend:** React, Bootstrap 5
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression / Decision Tree / Lasso (trained model)
- **Serialization:** Pickle

## ⚡ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

1. Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn app.server:app --reload
```

Your backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### 2. Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🔹 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                                                               |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/locations` | Returns list of all available locations                                   |
| POST   | `/predict`   | Predicts price based on input features: `location`, `sqft`, `bath`, `bhk` |

**Sample POST request:**

```json
{
  "location": "1st Phase JP Nagar",
  "sqft": 1000,
  "bath": 2,
  "bhk": 2
}
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "predicted_price": 75.0
}
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend Features

- Dynamic dropdown for **locations** fetched from `/locations`.
- Inputs for **BHK**, **bathrooms**, and **square footage**.
- Displays **Estimated Price** in ₹ Lakh.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly UI.

---

## 📦 Model & Pickle Files

- `model.pkl` → Trained machine learning model.
- `columns.pkl` → Stores the order of features and dummy locations for prediction.

> **Note:** Do **not** upload large pickle files to public repos in production. Use `.gitignore` or host them separately.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. User selects location, enters sqft, BHK, and bathrooms.
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/predict`.
3. FastAPI backend loads `model.pkl` and `columns.pkl`.
4. Input vector is created with dummy encoding for location.
5. Model predicts price and returns numeric value.
6. Frontend displays estimated price formatted in ₹ Lakh.

---

## 👨‍💻 Future Improvements

- Add **user authentication** for personalized recommendations.
- Support for **more advanced ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Deployment using **Docker + cloud service**.
- Add **historical price trends** for visualization.
